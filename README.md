# 1. Project Background
 has always been so fascinating about psychology field and exploring human's mind. This project is naturally thus drawn to me. The dataset is provided by a competition on Kaggle, exploring mental health using 1 target Depression based on different factors. This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes this data in order to uncover insights into the dataset and apply machine learning to build model predict Depression.
Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas. While the data is synthetic, the process is structured to highlight key patterns, model performance, and methodological rigor. Insights and scenario-based recommendations are presented across several critical areas:

 	**Feature Importance and Patterns:**
identifying the most influential factors on depression, such as work pressure, academic satisfaction, sleep duration, and financial stress.

 **Predictive Modeling and Evaluation:**
By applying a range of machine learning models, I assessed their predictive performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1 score. 

 **Scenario Analysis and Interpretations:**
Even with synthetic data, hypothetical scenarios are explored to understand the potential impact of changes in variables—such as reduced sleep duration or increased financial stress—on depression risk.

 **Methodological Lessons and Future Directions:**
This project outlines the lessons learned from working with synthetic data and suggests next steps, including applying these methods to real-world datasets or refining the existing approach for greater interpretability and robustness.

Through these areas, the project not only showcases technical proficiency in data analysis and machine learning but also provides a framework for understanding and addressing mental health-related questions through structured, data-driven methods.
